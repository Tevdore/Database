  Description 
Make a structure with parameters - mean, median, stDeviation, max, min.
Make a file with name "nums.txt" an write numbers, for example: "12,790, -986, 56, 6.89, 12.9008, 45, 567, 78, 17"
Read those numbers from a file with functions fopen(),open(),OpenFile() and sort them in an ascending order
find mean, median, stDeviation, max, min and write them in relevant structure members
1.fwrite is used to write char array symbols in a file.
2.fread is used to read from a file
3.Then those numbers are divided in a 2D char array
4.Sorting in an ascending order
5.Finding mean, median, min, max, stDeviation
6. filling the structure
